# How to reach a candidate

I often receive a lot of job "offers" on portals like LinkedIn or via mail.
And I noticed that even if i'm not totally closed to new job opportunities I rarely respond to the offers.
They just don't catch my attention.
When I decide to write back, I need to ask the same questions over and over again to find something more about a job proposition.
For couple of weeks I have been thinking of writing an article to help IT
recruiters to reach out new candidates. 
Recently I pop into a brilliant [podcast]() somewhere in the social media.
Piotr Bucki, vice-president of the company I'm working for, said everything in the subject. 
When I was listening to it in a tram I was keep nodding my head all the time. 
Piotr and I the identical conclusions and share the same ideas about the subject.
If you are a polish speaker, I encourage you to listen to the whole recording.
Nevertheless I'm gonna to stress and summarize the key points - the key to success.
