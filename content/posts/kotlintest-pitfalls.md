> common pitfalls and how to deal with them

## Intro

Our team currently started cruise to develop next version of ‘the API’ 
and new set of services emerged during that journey. We have free hand 
to sail to the open waters of technologies ocean, so can choose the best 
fit to our project. Our ship wharfed to island named kotlin language. 
Very quickly we discovered Kotlintest library on this island. When 
fighting the battle of writing test cases to our production code we had 
a mutiny incited by Kotlintest. In this article I want to describe the 
course of the rebellion and how our brave team suppressed it.
