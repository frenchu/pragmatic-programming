The problem is most often you will not get public IP address from your operator when using cellurar network. It means difficulties to access to your RaspberryPi and it&amp;rsquo;s network from remote location. On the other hand the device is not exposed to the Internet threats.
In my case I want to use my RPi to control survilance system installed in a holiday cottage.</description></item><item><title>LTE router on Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://pawelweselak.com/posts/rpi-lte-router/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pawelweselak.com/posts/rpi-lte-router/</guid><description>I finally managed to find some free time to take a look on Waveshare SIM7600E-H 4G HAT. I bought it to extend capabilities of my Raspberry Pi 4 model B single board computer.
Here, I want to give a short tutorial how to setup LTE WAN networking in Raspberry Pi SBC. I will describe how to make use of the network tooling in new Raspberry Pi OS which is based on recent Debian Bookworm release.</description></item><item><title>Setting up networking between VirtualBox VMs</title><link>https://pawelweselak.com/posts/vbox-networking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pawelweselak.com/posts/vbox-networking/</guid><description>There are several modes one can use for networking in VirtualBox. In this article I presented one way for network setup. VMs talk each other using internal network separated from the host machine. Additionaly, I created OpnSense router to access VMs in internal network from the host.
To quickly spin desired number of VMs I used VBoxManage CLI utility and Ubuntu VBox cloud image.
